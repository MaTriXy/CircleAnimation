## Note:

- Support Android 4.0.3+.

- If you want to run it under 2.x versions, just replace ObjectAnimator with `nineoldandroids`.

- For better performance, using it with `RecyclerView` may be a good idea.

- The build_for_jcenter_publish.gradle is for publishing library on Jcenter, do not run that.
